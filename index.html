This knowledge has a downside, it depends on the effort of the person.</p><p>We like to give people a challenge to start creating things or learning new things. That&rsquo;s why we have different free programs:</p><ol><li><a href=https://github.com/DIY-the-hard-way>DIY the hard way</a></li><li>Competitive programming</li></ol><p>With the first program you will be on your own, you will have to create a system or similar fulfilling a set of requirements. These projects can be done by yourself or in a team, it&rsquo;s up to you. They can be done whenever you want, the only condition is to <strong>finish the project with all the requirements fulfilled</strong>. You can use these projects in your curriculum.</p><p>The second one is more oriented to learn by doing and between people, helping each other at the same time that every week you have a problem to solve with a maximum time and space used, using what you have learned. Also in competitive programming you will be mentored. There will be sessions to teach you the skills.</p></main><footer><small>Copyright 2022 0xBuilders.</small></footer></body></html>
